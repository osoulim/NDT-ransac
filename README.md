# NDT-RANSAC

This repository contains the implementation of the NDT-RANSAC algorithm for robust point cloud registration.

## Overview

The NDT-RANSAC algorithm combines Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) and RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) to improve the accuracy and robustness of point cloud registration. This method is particularly useful in scenarios with significant noise and outliers.

## Features

- Robust point cloud registration
- Combination of NDT and RANSAC algorithms
- Improved accuracy in noisy environments

## Installation

To install and run the NDT-RANSAC algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
  ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/osoulim/NDT-ransac.git
  ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
  ```bash
   cd NDT-ransac
  ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To use the NDT-RANSAC algorithm, run the following command:

```bash
  python main.py
```
